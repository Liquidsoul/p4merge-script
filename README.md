# p4merge script

A script to run p4merge inspired from Gr√©gory Pakosz's [article](https://pempek.net/articles/2014/04/18/git-p4merge/) which can be installed using [`brew`](https://brew.sh).  
The idea is to install p4merge using `brew cask install p4merge` and have it accessible easily using the command line by installing `p4merge-script` using `brew`.
